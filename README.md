# JSR-305 Javadoc

Now that the [official repository of the JSR-305 Javadocs](https://jsr-305.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/) is no longer publicly accessible, we have decided to host a copy in this repository.

We currently have the Javadoc for the following versions of [jsr305.jar](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22com.google.code.findbugs%22%20AND%20a%3A%22jsr305%22):

 - [3.0.1](http://checkstyle-addons.github.io/jsr305-javadoc/3.0.1/)
 
Feel free to PR for new versions (or older versions which we don't list yet).
